Changes with cassandra-client 0.8.2

- id connections.
- introduce options.max_query to allow separate and configurable query timeouts.
- emit error event on thrift error.
- long query watch logs a trace when any query takes more than 10s.
- pooled connections need to quietly tear down transport connections when being reconnected.
- fix recoverable error logic in PooledConnection.execute.
- Make PooledConnection.execute() re-execution calls explicit (saw some strange inheritance problems when execute()
  was overloaded with different parameters).

- Set a timeout for login, learn and use steps. Defaults to 1000ms, 2000ms and
  1000ms respectively.

- Set a timeout for connecting to the cassandra server. Default timeout
  is 4000 ms, but a user can specify custom one by passing 'timeout'
  option to the PooledConnection / Connection constructor.

- Use a different route for logging CQL queries
  (node-cassandra-client.driver.cql).

  Timing is logged to 'node-cassandra-client.driver.timing' route.
